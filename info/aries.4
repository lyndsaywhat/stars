Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and it shows! Aries placements tend to put themselves first and have a go-getter attitude. Aries are brave and well-suited to leadership, and can have a pretty bad temper too. 

Fun fact: Many tremendously popular celebrities have their sun in Aries, including Alec Baldwin, Lady Gaga, Kourtney Kardashian, and Emma Watson. That go-getter attitude must have paid off!
