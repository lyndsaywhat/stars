Virgo is a similar sign to Capricorn, and its differences are in many ways influenced by its mutable quality. Virgos are, like Capricorns, good at planning and may on occasion seem stubborn, controlling, or pessimistic. But they differ in that Virgos are simultaneously vibrant and passionate in private, and often quiet and anxious to the naked eye. They excel in creating environments of comfort and safety to everyone, and are especially kind and generous. Virgos are also not averse to learning new things, and often love to read or write.

Fun fact: Virgos are best suited for relationships with Cancers; the kindness which both signs display make for wonderful, caring relationship dynamics, and they can always help each other feel loved!
