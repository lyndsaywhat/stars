Signs are a fundamental concept in astrology. They indicate personality traits and predict potential outcomes, with the type of trait they influence depending on the astral body. They relate to constellations subdivided in the sky, and each one corresponds to a sign - a planet in a particular section will have that section's sign. Signs are also related to houses and planets - there is a 1-1 correspondence between houses and signs, and planets may correspond to multiple signs or multiple signs may correspond to a planet. 

Each sign has several other conceptual aspects associated with it, which help with categorization. These aspects are:
 - Element: fire, water, air, or earth (see info pages: element, fire_signs, water_signs, air_signs, earth_signs)
 - Modality/mode: fixed, cardinal, mutable (see info pages: mode, fixed_signs, cardinal_signs, mutable_signs)
 - Polarity: positive or negative (see info pages: polarity, positive_signs, negative_signs)

The signs are as follows, in traditional Zodiac order. They produce quadruplets based on element.

Aries ♈ : Taurus ♉ : Gemini ♊ : Cancer ♋ : Leo ♌ : Virgo ♍ : Libra ♎ : Scorpio ♏ : Sagittarius ♐ : Capricorn ♑ : Aquarius ♒ : Pisces ♓
