In some ways, Cancers resemble Pisces. Cancers tend to be emotional and empathetic. But the key difference is that Cancers are not so quiet and introspective; they share their feelings freely and nurture everyone around them. They are sometimes perceived as overemotional because of this.

Fun fact: Cancer rules the 4th house, which, among other things, rules the kitchen - Cancers tend to be great cooks!
