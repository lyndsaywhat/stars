Leo is an incredibly strong sign with immediately recognizable personality traits. Leos are excellent leaders and highly ambitious, bold, and passionate. They often have the strongest personality in the room, only potentially beaten in this regard by certain Aries combinations. People with Leo sun placements tend to be highly independent and may come across as narcissistic or arrogant, and while they have no trouble making friends, they aren't always so concerned with keeping them. 

Fun fact: The author of this software is a Leo sun, and so is former president Barack Obama!
