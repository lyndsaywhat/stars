Sagittarius is often considered the most adventurous sign, with Sagittarius placements often going off the beaten path. Sagittariuses love to try new things and go new places, and also tend to be trustworthy. However, Sagittariuses tend to become preoccupied with their own matters, and may leave other people out to dry.

Fun fact: Many talented creators and artists are Sagittariuses, related to their willingness to stray from social norms. Steven Spielberg, Mark Twain, and Woody Allen are all Sagittariuses!
